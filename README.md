# Merkle Hash Tree

Merkle hash tree is a data structure that is able to check the integrity of large amounts of data without actually storing them. It will calculate hashes of data and be able to keep track of them only using the root node. Merkle hash tree is used in version control systems such as git, as well as blockchain transactions verification.
